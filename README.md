Key Features:

CRUD Operations: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items.
Data Validation: Ensures data integrity through input validation and error handling.
Error Handling: Provides informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
Logging: Captures exceptions and logs them for debugging and troubleshooting.
API Design: Adheres to RESTful principles and best practices for API design.
Prerequisites:

.NET Core 8
A database MSSQL Server
Installation:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Restore dependencies using dotnet restore.
Configure your database connection string in the appsettings.json file.
Migrate database schema using dotnet ef database:update.

Implement pagination for large datasets to improve performance and scalability.
Consider adding search and filtering capabilities to retrieve specific todo items based on criteria.
Enhance error handling to provide more specific and helpful error messages.
